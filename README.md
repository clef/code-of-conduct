# Code of conduct

Our community is dedicated to creating a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces at the discretion of the leaders of the community (for now, the founders of Clef, @landakram, @brennenbyrne, and @jessepollak).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact team@getclef.com immediately.

We expect community members to follow these rules in all Clef-related communities (including but not limited to IRC, Support chat, Twitter, Facebook) and at all Clef-related social events.
